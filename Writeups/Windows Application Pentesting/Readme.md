# Windows Application Penetration Testing
## Introduction



## Tools 
### CFF explorer
 - for recon to know how the application was built.

### TcpView
 - to view the connection between the remote host and the local machine.

### Procmon
 - process monitoring tools used to view which process is using which file.

### Burpsuite
 - if the application using http traffic to send and receive data we can you burpsuite to intercept the request and responses.

### Echomirage
 - if the application send data over non-http traffic like TCP then we can use echomirage by setting outbound and inbound rules to monitor the traffic.

### wireshark
 - it's s network analyser choose the interface and select the protocol you want to monitor and analyse.

### Regshot
 - used for analyzing registory modifications

### Processhacker
 - used to monitor the application process and extract stored credentials from the memory by searching the strings in the memory.

### Injection Attacks
> - CSV injection attacks at the file export feature.<br>
> - SQL injection in login areas and other intercepted requests.

### Reverse Engineering
 - use `jetbrains` decompiler and look for hardcoded credentials.
 - use `dotpeek`to view the source code for .net applications.

### Dll Hijacking 
- apply filter in processmonitor and check for the dll file which loads when the application process is running and create a payload with .dll extension from metasploit and place that in desired location.

### Sigcheck
- tool used to verify that the application is digitally signed or not.

### Visual Code grepper 
- tool used to automate source code analysis.
